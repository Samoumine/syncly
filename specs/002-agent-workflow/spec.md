# Feature Specification: Syncly Agent Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `[002-agent-workflow]`  
**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Design the Syncly agent workflow with a summarizing agent, a planning agent, and an orchestrator that coordinates them and exchanges payloads with the backend."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Receive consolidated project intelligence (Priority: P1)

When a program manager requests the latest project status through Syncly, they receive a single response that combines an AI-authored summary of project health with actionable next steps, even if underlying data is fragmented across services.

**Why this priority**: This journey delivers the primary value of reducing manual interpretation effort for leadership and is the core reason to build the workflow.

**Independent Test**: Provide realistic backend project data, trigger the workflow, and confirm the returned package contains both a narrative summary and prioritized recommendations that can be consumed without further AI calls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the backend supplies current project metrics and task statuses, **When** the workflow is invoked, **Then** the response includes a concise summary of overall progress, risks, and highlights backed by the received data.
2. **Given** the workflow has produced a summary, **When** the response is returned, **Then** it also lists prioritized recommendations with owners or categories so the program manager can act immediately.

### User Story 2 - Support automated planning follow-up (Priority: P2)

When the operations automation service detects delays or missed milestones, it can call the agent workflow to obtain mitigation steps and updated sequencing without waiting for human review.

**Why this priority**: Enables downstream automation and alerts, increasing the usefulness of the planning agent beyond human consumption.

**Independent Test**: Feed the workflow simulated delay data, verify the response indicates schedule recovery strategies, and confirm the backend can parse structured planning outputs for onward automation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** delayed tasks are present in the input payload, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** the recommendations explicitly address delay mitigation or re-sequencing.

---

### User Story 3 - Provide auditable agent collaboration (Priority: P3)

When compliance reviewers audit past agent-driven decisions, they can view metadata that shows which agent produced each part of the response and the order of execution.

**Why this priority**: Transparency reduces risk and supports trust in AI-driven project guidance.

**Independent Test**: Execute the workflow, inspect stored metadata or returned audit fields, and confirm they include agent identifiers, timestamps, and input references that can be matched to backend records.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the workflow runs successfully, **When** its output is logged or returned, **Then** it includes metadata indicating the summarizing and planning agents ran sequentially with their completion timestamps.

### Edge Cases

- Input payload omits required project sections (e.g., tasks lack owners or due dates) — workflow must indicate missing data and still return a partial summary.
- Summarizing agent times out or returns an error — orchestrator must notify the backend with a failure status while avoiding invocation of the planning agent.
- Planning agent detects no actionable gaps — response must explicitly state that current plans are on track instead of returning empty recommendations.
- Backend sends duplicate requests within a short window — workflow should use idempotency keys or timestamps to avoid conflicting guidance.
- Incoming data contains conflicting status information — summarizing agent must flag inconsistencies rather than silently choosing one version.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The orchestrating agent MUST accept project context payloads from the backend, validate required fields, and initiate the summarizing agent with the sanitized input.
- **FR-002**: The summarizing agent MUST produce a natural-language digest that captures overall progress, critical blockers, completion percentages, and notable achievements derived from the provided data.
- **FR-003**: The planning agent MUST consume the summarizing agent’s output plus original context to generate prioritized, actionable recommendations that include suggested owners or categories and timing guidance.
- **FR-004**: The orchestrator MUST combine the summary, recommendations, and execution metadata into a single structured response and deliver it back to the backend in a deterministic schema.
- **FR-005**: The orchestrator MUST enforce sequential execution (Summarizing → Planning) and prevent the planning agent from running when the summary stage fails validation.
- **FR-006**: The workflow MUST surface error states to the backend with descriptive messages and include retriable flags when the failure is transient (e.g., timeout).
- **FR-007**: The workflow MUST log agent inputs, outputs, and durations with correlation identifiers so backend services can audit each run.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **AgentRequest**: Encapsulates the backend payload including project identifiers, task lists, timeline data, and a correlation id for traceability.
- **ProjectSummary**: Represents the summarizing agent’s narrative output plus structured fields for progress indicators, risk flags, and data quality notes.
- **ActionPlan**: Captures the planning agent’s recommendations, ordered priority, suggested owners or teams, and timing guidance.
- **AgentRunMetadata**: Contains orchestrator-generated identifiers, timestamps, execution order, error codes, and retriable flags.

### Assumptions

- Backend requests will supply at least project name, current milestone statuses, and outstanding task lists.
- Backend is responsible for persisting the final combined response and exposing it to end-user interfaces.
- Agents operate within existing Syncly authentication boundaries; no external integrations are required for this workflow.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of workflow invocations return a combined summary and plan to the backend within 6 seconds of request receipt.
- **SC-002**: 90% of returned summaries are rated “clear and actionable” or better by pilot program managers during user acceptance reviews.
- **SC-003**: For projects flagged as delayed, at least one mitigation recommendation appears in 100% of planning agent outputs during acceptance testing.
- **SC-004**: Audit logs capture orchestrator correlation ids, agent completion timestamps, and success/failure codes for 100% of workflow runs during QA.
