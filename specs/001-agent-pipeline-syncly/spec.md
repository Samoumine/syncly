# Feature Specification: Syncly Agentic Workflow Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-agent-pipeline-syncly`  
**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement agentic pipeline in Syncly that orchestrates specialized agents to ingest updates from Slack, Notion, Trello, GitHub, Gmail via OAuth or API tokens, classify tasks as done/doing/blocked, summarize daily progress, blockers, next steps, detect sentiment, and send automated Slack/email reports."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Daily Digest (Priority: P1)

An operations manager connects Syncly to team collaboration tools and automatically receives a daily summary covering progress, blockers, and next actions in their preferred channel.

**Why this priority**: Delivers the core value of replacing manual status gathering with an automated, reliable daily report.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a daily run with connected integrations and verify a structured digest is delivered to the selected Slack channel or email distribution list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workspace with Slack and GitHub connected, **When** the daily collection window elapses, **Then** the manager receives a digest that lists each teammate with their completed and ongoing items grouped by integration source.
2. **Given** a delivered digest, **When** the manager reviews the report, **Then** each summary item references the original update (user, timestamp, source) so the manager can trace back if needed.

### User Story 2 - Blocker Escalation (Priority: P2)

The manager is alerted when any team member reports being blocked and can see why, who is affected, and suggested next steps within the same day.

**Why this priority**: Early blocker visibility prevents delays and demonstrates proactive team assistance.

**Independent Test**: Ingest updates containing blocker language and confirm the report highlights blockers, notifies the manager, and records the reason.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an activity log stating a task is blocked, **When** the pipeline processes the update, **Then** the digest highlights the blocker with the responsible owner and the captured reason.
2. **Given** a blocker detected during the day, **When** notification preferences include Slack, **Then** an immediate alert is posted to the configured channel summarizing the issue.

### User Story 3 - Manual Log Upload (Priority: P3)

A project coordinator without API credentials uploads a plain-text activity log and still receives a consistent summary alongside connected source data.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the system works in demos or restricted environments where OAuth access is unavailable.

**Independent Test**: Upload a sample log file and validate that its contents are parsed, included in the digest, and clearly labeled as manually provided data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a manual log upload with multiple updates, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** each entry appears in the digest with user, status classification, and associated next steps.
2. **Given** both connected integrations and manual uploads, **When** the daily digest is generated, **Then** the report merges all sources without duplicates and notes the origin of each entry.

---

### Edge Cases

- Activity sync yields no new updates; the digest must indicate "No updates" while confirming the pipeline executed successfully.
- Multiple updates reference the same task with conflicting statuses; the digest must apply the most recent timestamp and flag the conflict for review.
- Integration credentials expire or API requests are rate limited; the system must surface an actionable error message to the workspace admin without halting other data sources.
- Manual uploads contain malformed lines; the pipeline must skip invalid entries, log them, and continue processing valid items.
- Team members in different time zones submit updates after the cutoff; the orchestrator must include them in the next scheduled digest based on workspace time zone settings.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow workspace admins to connect or disconnect supported tools (Slack, Notion, Trello, GitHub, Gmail, Jira, Google Sheets) using OAuth or API tokens, and validate credentials before activation.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST accept manual activity log uploads and queue them for processing alongside automated integrations.
- **FR-003**: The orchestrating agent MUST schedule ingestion runs per workspace at configurable daily times and trigger on-demand runs initiated by an admin.
- **FR-004**: Specialized ingestion agents MUST normalize updates into a shared structure capturing actor, task description, timestamp, integration source, and raw text.
- **FR-005**: A classification agent MUST label each normalized update as "done", "doing", or "blocked" and record supporting rationale for the decision.
- **FR-006**: A summarization agent MUST generate daily digests that separate completed work, ongoing efforts, blockers, and recommended next actions at both individual and team levels.
- **FR-007**: The notifier agent MUST deliver digests and blocker alerts to configured Slack channels and/or email recipients and log delivery outcomes for auditing.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST perform sentiment analysis on updates and include a team mood indicator with brief rationale in the daily digest.
- **FR-009**: The application MUST store processed updates, classification results, and digests for at least 30 days to power dashboard history and resend capabilities.
- **FR-010**: Admins MUST be able to view processing status, recent errors, and integration health from an overview screen within Syncly.
- **FR-011**: The agents backend MUST expose orchestration and provider interaction endpoints via a FastAPI service that brokers communication with Slack, Notion, Trello, GitHub, Jira, and Gmail.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Integration Connection**: Represents a linked external tool, including credentials metadata, status, scopes granted, and last successful sync timestamp.
- **Activity Event**: A normalized record of a single update comprising author, content, integration source, timestamp, inferred task identifier, and sentiment score.
- **Task Status Summary**: Aggregated view of events grouped by task and contributor, capturing current status (done/doing/blocked), supporting notes, and blocker reasons when applicable.
- **Digest Report**: A compiled daily summary storing generation time, covered date range, lists of progress items, blockers, next actions, sentiment insights, and distribution log.
- **Notification Preference**: Workspace-level settings indicating desired delivery channels, recipients, schedule, and escalation rules for urgent blockers.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of scheduled daily digests are delivered to the selected channel by the configured local time without manual intervention during a two-week pilot.
- **SC-002**: Classification accuracy for done/doing/blocked labels meets or exceeds 90% when evaluated against a curated validation set of team updates.
- **SC-003**: Newly ingested updates appear on the dashboard and in the next digest within 15 minutes of ingestion for 95% of cases.
- **SC-004**: At least 80% of participating managers report that Syncly reduces the time spent preparing daily status summaries by 50% or more in post-pilot surveys.

## Assumptions

- Syncly remains the product name in all user-facing copy and documentation for this feature.
- Workspaces operate on a single configured time zone for digest scheduling, with default delivery at 9:00 AM local time unless changed by the admin.
- Pilot teams include 3â€“10 members, providing sufficient activity volume to evaluate classification accuracy and sentiment signals.
- Workspace admins possess the required permissions and API scopes to authorize integrations with their collaboration tools.
