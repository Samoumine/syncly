# Syncly AI Agents Constitution

## Preamble
This constitution establishes the foundational principles and standards for all AI agents operating within the Syncly ecosystem. These principles ensure consistent, high-quality, secure, and performant code that delivers exceptional user experiences.

---

## I. Core Principles

### Article 1: Code Quality Standards

**1.1 Clarity and Readability**
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Maintain consistent naming conventions: snake_case for Python, camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility (max 50 lines)
- Use type hints in Python and TypeScript interfaces for all public APIs
- Comment only when necessary to explain "why", not "what"

**1.2 Code Organization**
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for all modules and classes
- Organize imports: standard library → third-party → local modules
- Group related functions and classes logically
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between business logic, data access, and presentation layers
- Keep cyclomatic complexity below 10 per function

**1.3 Error Handling**
- Never silently catch and ignore exceptions
- Use specific exception types rather than bare `except` clauses
- Provide meaningful error messages with context
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures

**1.4 Documentation Standards**
- Document all public APIs, classes, and functions with docstrings
- Include parameter types, return types, and raised exceptions in docstrings
- Maintain up-to-date README.md files for each module
- Document architectural decisions in ADR (Architecture Decision Records) format
- Keep inline comments concise and relevant

## II. Testing Standards

### Article 2: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**2.1 Test Coverage Requirements**
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for all modules
- Achieve 100% coverage for critical business logic and security functions
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Include negative test cases for error handling validation
- Run tests automatically on every commit via CI/CD pipeline

**2.2 Testing Hierarchy**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation (mock dependencies)
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components and external services
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure response times meet SLA requirements
- **Security Tests**: Validate authentication, authorization, and data protection

**2.3 Test Quality Standards**
- Each test should be independent and idempotent
- Use descriptive test names following the pattern: `test_<action>_<expected_result>`
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for test structure
- Mock external dependencies to ensure test reliability
- Maintain test execution time under 5 seconds for unit tests

**2.4 Test Data Management**
- Use factories or fixtures for test data generation
- Never use production data in tests
- Clean up test artifacts after execution
- Seed test databases with predictable, minimal datasets
- Version control test fixtures and expected outputs

- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and improve performance
- Monitor slow query logs and optimize queries exceeding 100ms

**4.3 API Efficiency**
- Implement request rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user
- Use HTTP caching headers appropriately (ETag, Cache-Control)
- Compress responses with gzip/brotli for payloads > 1KB
- Implement API versioning to manage breaking changes
- Use GraphQL or field filtering to reduce payload sizes

**4.4 Scalability Considerations**
- Design stateless services to enable horizontal scaling
- Use message queues for async processing of heavy operations
- Implement circuit breakers for external service dependencies
- Design for graceful degradation under high load
- Monitor and alert on resource utilization thresholds

## V. Security and Privacy

### Article 5: Security First Approach

**5.1 Authentication and Authorization**
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations
- Use JWT tokens with short expiration times (15 minutes)
- Implement refresh token rotation

- Never log or expose sensitive credentials

**5.2 Data Protection**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256
- Use TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**5.3 Dependency Management**
- Keep all dependencies up-to-date with security patches
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities weekly
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review and approve all new dependency additions

**5.4 Audit and Compliance**
- Log all security-relevant events (authentication, authorization failures)
- Implement audit trails for data modifications
- Retain logs for minimum 90 days
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and relevant data protection regulations
- Conduct security reviews for all code changes
