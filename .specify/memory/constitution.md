# syncly Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
All code must adhere to high standards of readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Use consistent coding conventions across Python, JavaScript, and other languages. Avoid code duplication through proper abstraction. Ensure comprehensive documentation for all public APIs and complex logic. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes, with automated linting and formatting enforced.

### Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is required for all features. Unit tests must achieve at least 80% code coverage. Integration tests must cover critical user paths. End-to-end tests must validate complete user workflows. All tests must be automated and integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Test-driven development is encouraged for new features.

### User Experience Consistency
Maintain consistent user interfaces and interactions across all platforms (web, mobile, API). Follow established design patterns and component libraries. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Provide intuitive navigation and clear error messaging. User feedback must be systematically collected and incorporated into development cycles.

### Performance Requirements
Applications must meet defined performance benchmarks. API response times must be under 2 seconds for 95th percentile. Frontend interactions must be under 100ms. Efficient resource usage with memory and CPU limits. Scalable architecture supporting horizontal scaling. Regular performance monitoring and optimization are mandatory.

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack: Python 3.13 with uv, Node.js with npm, Docker for containerization. Security: Implement OWASP guidelines, regular security audits, encrypted data storage. Compliance: GDPR for data handling, accessibility standards, open source license compatibility.

## Development Workflow
Use Git Flow with feature branches. Pull requests require CI passing and code review approval. Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines. Semantic versioning for releases. Regular security and dependency updates. Documentation updates required for API changes.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and migration plan. All pull requests must verify compliance with principles. Complexity must be justified with performance and maintainability rationale. Use this constitution for resolving conflicts in development practices.
